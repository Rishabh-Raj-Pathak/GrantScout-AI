Imagine you‚Äôre a startup founder with a brilliant idea. You‚Äôre excited to build, but there‚Äôs one big problem: money. You know there are grants and funding programs out there, but finding them feels like searching for a needle in a haystack.

And that‚Äôs where GrantScout AI comes in.

### üéØThe Problem
Today, if you want to find a grant, you have to dig through endless government websites, private foundations, and accelerator pages. It‚Äôs messy. It takes hours. And often, you miss out on opportunities because they‚Äôre buried in the noise.

### ‚≠êThe Magic
GrantScout AI makes this whole process simple.
Just tell it what you‚Äôre looking for, maybe you‚Äôre building an AI startup, maybe a climate tech idea, or maybe you‚Äôre a student with an innovation project. GrantScout listens, understands, and instantly brings back the most relevant funding opportunities.

No spreadsheets. No endless tabs. Just answers.

How It Feels
It‚Äôs like having a personal scout, one that never sleeps, never gets tired, and knows exactly where to look. It gathers grants from all over the world, organizes them neatly, and shows you the ones that actually matter for you.

### ü©µThe Experience
The interface is clean, fast, and human. You can type in your query like you‚Äôre talking to a friend. GrantScout will even ask you clarifying questions, so it understands exactly what you need.

And when it finds the right matches, it doesn‚Äôt just dump data. It presents clear, simple cards with deadlines, eligibility, and funding amounts. So you know instantly if it‚Äôs worth applying.

### üöÄThe Impact
With GrantScout AI, what used to take days of manual research now takes minutes. Founders save time, discover hidden opportunities, and focus on what really matters : building their ideas.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture & Implementation

### Core Agent Framework

- **Portia SDK Integration**: Orchestrates multi-step workflows for grant discovery
- **Conversational State Management**: Maintains context across query refinement sessions
- **Query Processing Pipeline**: Natural language to structured search criteria conversion
- **Result Ranking Algorithm**: Relevance scoring based on startup profile matching

### Portia Tools Integration

Based on the [Portia Tools Catalogue](https://docs.portialabs.ai/portia-tools), this implementation utilizes:

**Open Source Tools:**

- **Browser Tool**: General purpose web navigation for accessing grant portals
- **Crawl Tool**: Graph-based website traversal for discovering funding pages across domains
- **Extract Tool**: Content extraction from grant portals using Tavily Extract
- **Search Tool**: Internet search capabilities via Tavily for supplementary grant discovery
- **LLM Tool**: Query processing, result summarization, and conversation management

**Custom Tools:**

- **ScraperAPI Integration (FALLBACK)**: Extended browser capabilities with proxy rotation and anti-bot measures
- **Grant Parser**: Structured data extraction specifically for funding opportunity formats
- **Email Service**: SMTP integration for digest delivery and notification management

### Data Processing Pipeline

- **Multi-source Aggregation**: Concurrent crawling of government and private funding sources
- **Content Normalization**: Standardized schema for grant data (amount, deadline, eligibility)
- **Relevance Scoring**: ML-based matching of opportunities to startup criteria
- **Deduplication**: Hash-based filtering to eliminate duplicate funding opportunities

```javascript
// React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
{
  "framework": "React 19",
  "bundler": "Vite",
  "styling": "Tailwind CSS",
  "http_client": "Axios",

  "cors": "flask-cors 6.0.1"
}
```

### API Integrations

```bash
# Required Environment Variables
PORTIA_API_KEY=          # Portia cloud tools access
OPENAI_API_KEY=          # LLM inference (GPT-4o-mini)
TAVILY_API_KEY=          # Web search via Tavily

## üîß Implementation Details

### Grant Discovery Workflow

```python
def find_grants(user_input, mode="form"):
    # 1. Query processing and criteria extraction
    structured_query = extract_criteria(user_input, mode)

    # 2. Multi-source data collection using Portia tools
    portals = identify_relevant_portals(structured_query)
    grants = []
    for portal in portals:
        page_data = browser_tool.navigate_to_url(portal.url)
        grant_pages = crawl_tool.discover_grant_pages(portal.url)
        extracted_grants = extract_tool.parse_grant_data(grant_pages)
        grants.extend(extracted_grants)

    # 3. Data processing and ranking
    validated_grants = validate_and_normalize(grants)
    scored_grants = calculate_relevance_scores(validated_grants, user_input)

    # 4. Response generation
    return generate_agent_response(scored_grants, user_input)
```

### ScraperAPI Integration

ScraperAPI provides proxy rotation, JavaScript rendering, and anti-bot evasion for accessing government and institutional funding portals that implement blocking mechanisms.

```python
# Custom browser tool with ScraperAPI
def fetch_with_scraper_api(url):
    params = {
        "api_key": SCRAPER_API_KEY,
        "url": url,
        "render": "true",           # JS rendering
        "keep_headers": "true"      # Preserve request headers
    }
    return requests.get(SCRAPER_ENDPOINT, params=params)
```

**Groq API Integration**  
Direct Groq integration would be valuable for rapid prototyping and cost-effective inference. Groq's competitive pricing and fast response times make it an attractive option for agent workflows.

**Tool Composition**  
Better support for composing multiple tools in complex workflows, particularly for multi-step data collection and processing pipelines.
